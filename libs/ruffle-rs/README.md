Ruffle is an Adobe Flash Player emulator written in the Rust programming language. Ruffle targets both the desktop and the web using WebAssembly.

In short, it allows playing SWF contents in browsers without Adobe Flash Player.

Ruffle only supports contents which are based on Action Script 1.0 or 2.0 on Sept 20 2020, while AS 3.0 is not supported.
